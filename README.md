# ES23_learning
This repository is for preparation to EuroSkills 2023 competiton

There are a lot of subrepositories here, where:
- *express* holds simple node js with express server
- *html css* consists of subfolders where I practiced creating simple Web component and simple web page without JS usage
- *vue-app* and *vue-learning* are Vue projects, where *vue-learning* holds clear practicing, and *vue-app* a simple app with sqlite database for products.
